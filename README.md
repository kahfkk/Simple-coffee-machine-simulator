# JetBrains Academy. Project: Coffee Machine
## General Info
To learn more about this project, please visit [Project: Coffee Machine](https://hyperskill.org/projects/33?track=8)
## About
This is the simplest console simulator of a coffee machine.
Opportunities:
1. Display resources
2. Buy different types of coffee (the amount of resources and money will change)
3. Replenish resources (the number of resources will change)
4. Take money (the amount of money will change)

The machine will display a message if there are not enough resources for coffee.

The program is implemented according to the principle of operation of real electronic devices: in the "event management" class there is a method that processes user input from main and generates actions based on events and input. Console input is not used anywhere except main.
## How to Run
Download the files to your local repository and open the project in your choice of IDE and run the project. You will be prompted to enter the action you want to perform with the coffee machine.
